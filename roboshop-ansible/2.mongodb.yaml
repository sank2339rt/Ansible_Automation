# PLAY: Configure MongoDB Database
# Purpose: Installs and starts the MongoDB service for the RoboShop project.
# ==============================================================================
- name: mongodb configure
  hosts: mongodb          # Targets ONLY the servers listed under [mongodb] in inventory.ini
  become: yes             # Elevates privileges to 'root' (sudo) required for installations
  
  tasks:
    # 1. Provide the Linux package manager with the location of the MongoDB software
    - name: copy mongo repo
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: mongo.repo   # A local file on your control node (must exist in the same folder!)
        dest: /etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo  # The standard Linux directory for package sources

    # 2. Download and install the database engine
    - name: install mongodb server
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: mongodb-org
        state: present    # Idempotent: Only installs if it's not already there

    # 3. Modify the configuration to allow incoming traffic from our backend apps
    - name: allow remote connections
      ansible.builtin.replace:
        path: /etc/mongod.conf    # The main configuration file
        regexp: '127.0.0.1'       # Find the default local-only IP
        replace: '0.0.0.0'        # Replace it with the universal 'listen to all' IP

    # 4. Turn the database on and ensure it survives a server reboot
    - name: start and enable mongodb
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: mongod
        enabled: yes      # Configures auto-start on system boot
        state: started    # Starts the service right now

    # ==========================================================================
    # HANDLER PLACEHOLDER: 
    # This is commented out because restarting the DB forcefully every time 
    # is bad practice. We will use proper Ansible Handlers for this later.
    # ==========================================================================
    # - name: restart mongodb
    #   ansible.builtin.service:
    #     name: mongod
    #     state: restarted
